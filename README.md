## Figuring out the Keys

- If you do not intend to use the mobile app or smart home functionalities, you can use tuya-cli to link the device and get the required keys

- Otherwise follow [this awesome guide](https://community.openhab.org/t/step-by-step-guide-for-adding-tuya-bulbs-wi-fi-smart-led-smart-life-app-to-oh2-using-tuya-mqtt-js-by-agentk/59371/187) on how to get the data on a rooted BlueStacks phone.
I ended up downloading [version 3.7.1 of SmartLife](https://apkpure.com/smart-life-smart-living/com.tuya.smartlife/download/73-APK?from=versions%2Fversion) separately, since the newer version of Tuya's apps encrypt their preferences.
